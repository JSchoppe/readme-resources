# Readme Resources
Contains common resources used in my readmes as well as a space for me to experiment with new readme styling without doing tons of commits on other projects.
I made this repo to avoid stale links to vendor branding resources, branding is only used explicitly to demonstrate that other projects were created with a
given software package.
